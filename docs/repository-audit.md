# Repository audit

Audit date: 2026-11-09. Source: authenticated GitHub API and the initial local clone.

| Item | Finding |
|---|---|
| Remote / visibility | `https://github.com/LPlatform/L_Platform_Web` / private |
| Default branch | `main` (configured by GitHub; initially had no ref) |
| Branches / commits | Repository was empty: no refs, commits, files or prior history. An empty bootstrap commit establishes `main`. |
| Working tree / recent changes | Clean after clone; no user changes existed. |
| Manifests / dependencies / lockfiles | None existed at audit time. |
| Actions / tests / ignored files / release config | None existed at audit time. |
| README | None existed at audit time. |

No source or useful configuration was present to preserve. This PR adds governance and workflow foundations plus repository-policy smoke tests only. The Next.js app, package scripts, lockfile, product tests, deploy host and release credentials remain unconfigured; workflows disclose these gaps rather than report absent checks as passed.
